# Changelog

All notable changes to `@todovue/tv-theme-button` will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

---
## [1.0.3] - 2025-11-15
### 🛠️ Changed
- Styles are now served as a separate CSS file (`dist/tv-theme-button.css`) generated by Vite during the build process.
- Users must now explicitly import the stylesheet in their application:
  - For Vue/Vite SPA: `import '@todovue/tv-theme-button/style.css'` in `main.ts`
  - For Nuxt 3/4: Add `'@todovue/tv-theme-button/style.css'` to the `css` array in `nuxt.config.ts`

### ✨ Added
- Added `sideEffects` field to `package.json` to support proper tree-shaking with CSS files.
- Added `./style.css` export path in `package.json` for explicit CSS imports.
- Improved SSR/SSG compatibility, especially for Nuxt 3/4 applications.

### 📦 Dependencies
- Removed dependency on `vite-plugin-css-injected-by-js` from `devDependencies`

---
## [1.0.2] - 2025-11-13
### 🐛 Fixed
- Fixed SSR hydration error in Nuxt caused by localStorage access during server-side rendering
- Fixed component import path in demo application

---
## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-19
### 🛠️ Changed
- The library build now uses `src/entry.ts` (exports both the component and the plugin) instead of directly exporting the `.vue` file.
- CSS injection via JS has been removed for the library build (it is only kept for the demo), generating a `tv-theme-button.css` file optimized for SSR/Nuxt.
- Changed node-version to workflows release.yml to 20.

### ✨ Added
- Plugin installation support: `app.use(TvThemeButton)` or `app.use(TvThemeButtonPlugin)`.
- Explicit export of the style file: `import '@todovue/tv-theme-button/style.css'`.
- Documentation for usage in SSR and Nuxt 3 applications.
